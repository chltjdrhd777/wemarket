## 0. Update

v0.1.0 = I used styled-components

v0.2.0 = I changed styled-components to "emotion". emotion is too great to replace styled-components. Especially, The optimized inline style system is trully overwhelming awesome

## 1. Description

This is a react starter with redux, typescript mainly.  
I really worried about how to setting react with redux fast.  
Whenever I delete and download packages and set the default structure repeatedly, I finally noticed that It is a waste of time(**_really_**)

So, I made this default setting, and I am gonna use this for my whole project.

## 2. How to use

It is simple. The only thing you should do is just

1. Make your own project folder

2. Open your terminal

3. If you don't have "git", please install it first, and type this on your terminal

```Bash
    $ git intit
    $ npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```

you will see the whole latest react project are made.  
Then, you should delete

> a. public  
> b. src

After that, plaese download and unzip my gitrepository files, copy all, and paste them to your react folder

Finally, please enter

```
    $ npm install
    $ npm install --only=dev
```
